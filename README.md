## 📡✨ Network Traffic & Email Classification Model
### Network Traffic Classification 🚦 and Email Classification 📬 project!
This model is built to classify and analyze different types of network activities and emails using synthetic datasets. 🧠

## 📚 Datasets: 
🌐 Network Traffic Dataset

- 🧭 Browsing
- 🎥 Streaming
- 📤 File Transfer
- 📞 VoIP
- 🚨 Attack

## 📩 Email Classification Dataset:

- ✅ Normal
- 📰 Newsletter
- 💼 Business
- ⚠️ Suspicious
- ❌ Malicious

## 🛠️ How to Run?
- 👉 Step 1: Open the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) 📓
- 👉 Step 2: Run each cell step-by-step ➡️ 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ ... sequentially!
- 🛎️ Important: Do NOT skip any cells 🚫⏭️  
Follow the order strictly for smooth execution 🧩

## 📦 Required Packages
🧹 Install the required packages first:

```
#Run this cell to install required packages
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **sklearn**

## 🖼️ Model Outputs

- 📈 **Confusion Matrices**: to understand prediction vs truth
- 🌳 **Decision Trees**: visualization of how decisions are made
- 📃 **Classification Reports**: precision, recall, F1-score
- 🧠 **Analysis Reports**: insights from feature behavior
- 🔥 **Feature Importance Plots**: which features matter most!

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: cleaning and standardization
- 🛠️ **Model Building**: using Decision Tree Classifier 🌳
- 🔍 **Training & Testing Split**: to evaluate model fairly
- 🎯 **Performance Metrics**: to judge model performance
- 📉 **Visual Insights**: plots and graphs

## 🚀 Quick Start

- 📥 Load the dataset.
- 🧹 Preprocess the data (scaling/cleaning).
- 🔥 Train Decision Tree Model.
- 📊 Generate confusion matrices, decision tree plots, reports.
- 📈 Analyze feature importance and outputs.

*(Just run each cell one after the other and enjoy the magic ✨!)*
